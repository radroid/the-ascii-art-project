# The Ascii Art Project
Welcome to The Ascii Art Project!
> *This project layout or template was created using [auto-project-builder](https://www.github.com/radroid/auto-project-builder) created by **RaDroid**.*
> *It is a library to automate the boring process of creating project files before you start working on it.*

It is a CLI program that takes a pictures, converts it into an ASCII art and prints it on the shell (terminal) window.

### For a Developer
#### Code Review
I would really appreciate any kind of feedback on the way I have chosen to tackle this problem. Keep in mind, I am a beginner and even a small piece of advice can go a long way. **Be as critical as you can!** Thank you for spending time to look at my code.

I would appreciate comments on anything and everything, but here are some to get you started:
- Architecture or **Design** of the code.
- Style and **Documentation**.
- **Testing**: this one can be get time consuming compared to the others.

New to code reviewing? Even I am. You can refer to [this guide](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html) for advice on Code Reviews.
